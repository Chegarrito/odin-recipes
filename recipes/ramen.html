    <h2>What is ramen?</h2>

    <p>
        Ramen is a type of Japanese noodle soup. Once a simple street food, it’s now become a gourmet phenomenon around the world. Every bowl of ramen has three main components:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Broth:</strong>A good bowl of ramen begins with a hearty, flavorful broth. Most broths begin with a combination of Japanese soup stock, or “dashi,” and chicken or pork stock. Each ramen chef uses a different “tare,” or flavoring base, that they add to each bowl of broth before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong>Ramen noodles contain wheat flour, salt, water and a special alkaline water called “kansui.” “Kansui” is what gives the noodles their unique flavor and springy texture. Noodle shape and thickness often change depending on the type of ramen you’re eating.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong>Ramen chefs artfully arrange each bowl with toppings like fried veggies, sliced meat and sheets of seaweed before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Ramen is unique in the Japanese food scene because, unlike more traditional foods, the combination possibilities are basically endless. People are constantly coming up with new ways to eat it, including ramen carbonara, ramen noodle slaw and even ramen burgers.</p>
