        <h2>What is lasagna?</h2>
        <p class="description">
            <strong>Lasagna</strong>, also known as <strong>lasagne</strong>,is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest 
            types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian
            dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as 
            ragu (ground meats and tomato sauce), bechamel sauce, vegetables, 
            cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), 
            and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, 
            which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled 
            with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting 
            baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.
